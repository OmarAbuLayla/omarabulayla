    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Biomedical Engineer and Research Assistant with a background in biomedical signal
      processing and machine learning. My work focuses on developing and evaluating feature
      representations and neural models for cross-subject biosignal classification, including
      time-frequency and wavelet-based methods alongside recurrent and transformer architectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have gained research experience through academic projects and research appointments, and I
      am currently contributing to manuscripts submitted to IEEE conferences and journals. My
      broader research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, biomedical signals,
      and human–machine interaction, and I am open and adaptable to exploring new research
      directions and methodologies.

      <h3>EMG-Based Speech Recognition</h3>

      <p>
        This research project investigates sentence-level EMG-based speech recognition using
        surface electromyography, with an emphasis on cross-subject generalization and robustness.
        The work integrates feature representation learning and deep learning models to evaluate
        system performance under realistic inter-subject variability and noise conditions.
      </p>

      <p>The project involves several interconnected research components:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Feature Representation Learning:</strong>
          Evaluation of time-frequency and wavelet-based feature extraction methods for EMG-based
          speech recognition, focusing on robustness and generalization.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Neural Architectures for Biosignal Classification:</strong>
          Design and assessment of recurrent and transformer-based models for EMG time-series
          classification, with attention to training stability and cross-subject performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Robustness and Noise Analysis:</strong>
          Experimental analysis of system behavior under noise and subject variability to improve
          reliability and generalization.
        </li>
      </ul>
